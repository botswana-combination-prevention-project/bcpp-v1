Overview
========

Dispatch data from the main server to mobile devices or netbooks. Data is "dispatched" to the device 
and edited on the device. When editing is done, data is returned to the server. While "dispatched" 
data on the server may not be altered.

Devices are "prepared" to be used with :mod:`bhp_dispatch`. Once "prepared", data items may be dispatched
to the device, edited and returned.
